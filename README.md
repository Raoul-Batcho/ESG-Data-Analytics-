# ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes the ESG dataset, which contains information about various countries around the world, provides information on 17 key sustainability themes spanning environmental, social, and governance categories.
In order to shift financial flows so that they are better aligned with global goals, the World Bank Group (WBG) is working to provide financial markets with improved data and analytics that shed light on countries’ sustainability performance.
Specifically, this project focuses on the relationship between the following indicators over time:
-	Access to electricity (% of population)
-	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)
-	GDP growth (annual %)
-	Government expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure)
-	Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)
-	Scientific and technical journal articles
-	Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)

## Data Collection
The data for this project was collected from the World Bank Data Hub platform which provides access to a wide range of datasets related to global development. The dataset used in this project contains information about 
-	Access to electricity (% of population)
-	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)
-	GDP growth (annual %)
-	Government expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure)
-	Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)
-	Scientific and technical journal articles
-	Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)
for various countries from 1960 to 2023.
## Data Wrangling and Exploration
To wrangle and explore the data, the Python libraries Pandas and Seaborn were used. Various visualizations were created using Seaborn to explore the data and identify any trends or patterns.
Analysis
To analyze the relationship between the above-mentioned indicators over time, data visualization was created using matplotlib and seaborn. This allows users to explore the relationship between these variables for three countries, namely Togo, Sub Sahara, and North America over time periods.
## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this project:
•	Pandas: for dataset handling
•	Seaborn: for visualization
•	Matplotlib.pyplot: for visualization
•	Numpy: for calculation
## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the relationship between the following indicators over time in Togo, Sub Sahara and North America:
-	Access to electricity (% of population)
-	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)
-	GDP growth (annual %)
-	Government expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure)
-	Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)
-	Scientific and technical journal articles
-	Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)
The data visualizations created allows for a deeper understanding of these relationships and highlight the importance of these variables comparatively in three countries which are Togo, Sub Sahara and North America.
